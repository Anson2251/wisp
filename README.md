A Simple GTK4 Chat Interface with Relm4

This is an experimental project I'm working on to help me get familiar with GTK4 and Rust using the Relm4 framework. The project implements a simple chat interface where messages are displayed in styled bubbles, differentiating between user messages and LLM (Language Model) responses.
